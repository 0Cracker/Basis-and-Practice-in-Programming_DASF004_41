# Week 2: String, Overflow and Type Casting

## Overview
Welcome to your second week of learning C programming! 
This week, we will cover the basics of writing and running a simple C program. By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Overflow
- Handling String with <string.h> 
- Type Casting/Conversion
- 

### **Time Breakdown**
- **Introduction & Explanation (10 min)**
- **Writing a Simple C Program (10 min)**
- **Working with Variables and Data Types (15 min)**
- **Taking User Input (20 min)**
- **Exercise & Q/A (15 min)**

---

## **1. Writing Your First C Program (10 min)**
A C program consists of functions and statements enclosed in `{}`. Every program starts with a `main()` function. Below is a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

### **Example:** Hello, World!
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
### **Explanation:**
- `#include <stdio.h>`: This is a preprocessor directive that includes the standard input-output library.
- `int main()`: This is the main function where program execution starts.
- `printf("Hello, World!\n");`: This prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
- `return 0;`: Ends the program successfully.

### **Exercise 1 (5 min):**
Modify the above program to print your name instead of "Hello, World!".

---

## **2. String (15 min)**
Variables are used to store data. In C, you must declare a variable before using it.

### **Functions in <string.h>**

### **Example:** Using Variables
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char hello[20]="hello";
    char world[20]="world";
    printf("%s%s\n",hello,world);
    strcat(hello,world)
    printf("%s and length of hello string is: %d\n",hello,strlen(hello));
    return 0;
}
```

### **Exercise 2 (10 min):**
Create a program that introduce yourself by getting input of your last name, first name and age.

---

## **3. Typecasintg **
You can converse data type 

### **Example:** User Input
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    printf("You are %d years old.\n", age);
    return 0;
}
```

### **Exercise 3 (10 min):**
Write a program that ask score of Math, English, Korean and print average of score.

### **Example Output:**

## **4. Assignment (10 min): Medical Checkup Program**
Inspired by previous assignments, let's create a structured task:

### **Task:** Write a C program that simulates a basic medical checkup. Your program should:
1. Ask the user for their age, gender (M/F), height (in meters), weight (in kg), blood type (A, B, or O), and body temperature.
2. Print all this information in a single `printf()` statement, using proper formatting.

### **Example Output:**
```
You are 24 years old and your gender is "M".
Your height and weight are 1.74 m, 74.00 kg.
Your blood type is 'A'.
Your body temperature is 36.50 degrees Celsius.
```

### **Hints:**
- Use `printf()` for output formatting.
- Use `\n` for line breaks and `\t` for spacing.
- Store values in variables and use `%d`, `%f`, and `%c` format specifiers accordingly.

---

## **Summary & Wrap-Up (10 min)**
This week, we covered:
- Writing a simple C program
- Using `printf()` for output
- Declaring variables and using data types
- Taking user input with `scanf()`
